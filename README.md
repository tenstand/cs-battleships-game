# CS Battleships Game

This Battleships game has been created in Python and runs in the Code Institute mock terminal, Heroku.

# The game

The game is based on the classic board game. In this version it is a single user playing against the computer. The computer has 5 ships on the grid, which contains vertical and horizontal spaces. The player will then have 10 turns to guess the row and column to identify a square that contains a ship. 

Guesses are marked with an 'X' if they are a hit or a '0' if they are a miss or an '_' for an empty space.

The player wins if they manage to sink all the computer's battleships within 10 guesses otherwise the game ends.

# Features

The board is randomly generated. The player can not see where the computer's ships are and also maintains the score.

A player can not add coordinates outside of the 8*8 board and cannot enter the same guess twice.

# Testing

I have manually tested this project by running it through PEP8 as well as testing it in the terminal and in Heroku.

# Bugs

I had to fix a number of bugs to get the project to work. Everytime I ran it in the terminal, I was able to go to find the problem and make the changes necessary. All bugs have now been fixed.

# Deployment

The project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal Heroku by:
Login to Heroku
Create new app and name it
Click 'Settings'
Go to Buildpacks add Python and Nodejs in that order.
Do to the 'Deploy section'
Select Github and search for Github repository name, search and connect.
Click on the manual Deploy option (Deploy Branch)


# Credits and acknowledgements

I used a number of YouTube tutorials to help me with this project.

# Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank my mentor for giving me some excellent tutorial sessions, which helped me understand Python more and for his very helpful feedback.
